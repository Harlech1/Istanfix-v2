## 🏷 Project Title
Istanfix

## 🧠 Project Purpose
Istanfix is a database-driven information system designed to help users report and track public infrastructure problems (e.g. broken streetlights, potholes, damaged benches) across Istanbul. The project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in database modeling and application development. Keep it simple.

## 🧱 Project Components

### 1. Veri Modeli (Data Model)

#### ✅ Gereksinim Analizi
Users should be able to:
- Report new infrastructure issues
- View reported issues
- Update the status of an issue
- Filter/search issues by district or category
- Admins can delete irrelevant/spam reports

#### 🧩 Kavramsal Model
Design a **Varlık-İlişki (ER) Şeması** including:
- Primary Keys, Composite Attributes, Derived Attributes
- Example Entities:
  - User (ID, Name, Email, Role)
  - Report (ID, Description, Image, Status, CreatedAt)
  - Location (ID, District, Address)
  - Category (ID, Name)
  - Admin (ID, UserID)

#### 🔁 Mantıksal Model
Convert the ER schema into a **Relational Model**:
- Normalize to at least **3NF** or **BCNF**
- Clearly list all functional dependencies

#### 💽 Fiziksel Model
Create database tables using:
- Preferred DBMS: SQLite
- Use appropriate datatypes and constraints

### 2. Uygulama (Application)

- Platform: Web or Desktop
- Required Features:
  - View existing reports
  - Create a new report
  - Edit an existing report
  - Delete a report (admin only)
- Technologies: use pure html + css + js

### 3. Rapor (Final Report)

The report must include:
- Detailed requirement list
- ER diagram
- Relational schema
- Functional dependencies
- Normalization steps (if needed)
- DDL (CREATE TABLE statements)
- SQL Queries used in the app (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Triggers, functions, and procedures (if any)
- Application architecture overview
- Technologies used
- Team member responsibilities
